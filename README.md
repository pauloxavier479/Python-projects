- [3in1 game](https://github.com/pauloxavier479/Python-projects/blob/main/3%20in%201%20game.ipynb)
A game script made on Jupyter Notebook that allows the user to select and interact with 3 different games: Rock, Paper, Scissors; Tic Tac Toe; and a Slot Machine game. This last one allows the user to add currency, define a bet value, and roll for a chance of a prize calculated based on the bet. Each game also gives the user the option to return to a Main Menu and choose a different game to play.
